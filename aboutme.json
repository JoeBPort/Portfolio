        "aboutme": " \t I'm a senior at Ferris State University majoring in Computer Information Systems (CIS). CIS gives its students a solid foundation in application development and business. I've taken multiple mobile applications, Java, MySQL, and web application development courses. I'm particularly interested in mobile and web application development.  I’ve worked for Ferris State's Automation and Continuity (AC) team from the fall of 2009 to the spring of 2015. In AC we worked as a small team to develop web applications and smaller programs for various customers on campus. \n \n \t I really enjoy the problems solving and collaboration aspects of team work. There’s nothing like solving a problem that you’ve been working on for weeks especially with a group of people. I have a genuine interest in learning and I am very resourceful when solving a problem. I don’t believe that classrooms can give you all of what you need to know to be successful on the job. From my experience, I’ve learned a lot more on the job than I have in the classroom especially when it comes to theory vs. practice. Most of the web application languages that I know have been self taught. This was out of pure interest and necessity for the job.  My interests extend outside of work and the classroom. I’ve competed in various computer competitions through Business Professional of America (BPA) and through Association of Information Technology Professionals (AITP).  My favorite course at Ferris State was Systems Analysis and Design and I also competed in systems analysis and design through AITP. \n \n \t I am very open to relocating and am interested in working in larger cities such as Grand Rapids, Lansing, Chicago, Minnesota, Seattle, Raleigh and more."
